'''A tuple looks just like a list except you use parentheses instead of square 
brackets. Once you define a tuple, you can access individual elements by 
using each itemâ€™s index,'''
my_t = (3,4,4,5)
'''Tuples are technically defined by the presence of a comma; the parentheses make them 
look neater and more readable. If you want to define a tuple with one element, you 
need to include a trailing comma:'''
my_t = (3,)
